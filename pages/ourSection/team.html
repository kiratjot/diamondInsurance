            <div class="info">
                <p>Born and brought up in Punjab, India. Attended boarding school from the very beginning of my school years from Dagshai Public School, Shimla to Yadavindra Public School, Patiala. Enjoyed education and the experiences throughout school, but one thing I enjoyed the most throughout my youth was athletics. I had been titled best athlete of the year for 3 consecutive years while attending Yadavindra Public School. With growing success as an athlete I was then given the honor to the team captain of the school. I was also selected take part in the India Under-19 Camp for the world school games.Upon graduating from high school, I moved towards my degree. B.com, from the state university of Punjab (Punjab University).With an urge to experience life abroad and put my skills to test, after completion of my degree my family and I started to work towards settling in Canada.I arrived in Canada in 2011 and started to work towards a better future. My first job in Canada a began a couple of days upon my arrival to the country. My very first job was as a cashier at a local gas station. Knowing that I had the ability of a brighter future, I took my first step towards the insurance business, I felt a sense of belonging and a confidence growing inside of me. With growing success, I was the top producer for two consecutive years, therefore I decided to branch out and start a business of my own. I am now the President of Diamond Insurance Group Inc, owned and operated myself.With a growing network through my business, I had the privilege to be a very active member of the Liberal party of Canada. I am currently the Vice President of the Fundraising Committee of Liberal East and a Board Member of the Riding of Brampton West. Alongside I served as an executive member of the International Film Festival of South Asia. I am also a very active member of Punjabi Business and Professionals association, and was honored in 2016.</p>
